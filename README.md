This app was created as a joint-final project for the Mobile Software Development class at AIT (Aquincum Institute of Technology) in December 2023. 

We created this app as a way to keep track of places that one may want to visit / has visited, 
with a map screen to add locations by clicking in desired locations, and a list screen which lists the locations that are on the map.
